# Pokemon

This analysis is for BIOS 707 project at Duke, trying to predict the Pokemons around all over the world. The data was collected only in one week, with 29,000 observations in total. Data cleaning was finished in R, and Python was used to handle the data in analysis. The analysis includes lasso/ridge regression on multinomial outcomes, Random Forest, Boosting and K-NN (k = 3, 4, ... 10)

The final result is the model trained by all data using Random Forest. Boosting is a good method but it is too slow.
